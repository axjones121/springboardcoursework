1.HTTP is an application-layer protocol transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTMLAllCollection. It is used to communicate between web browsers and servers. 

2. Url is the address of a webpage. Stands for Universal resource locator. 

3. DNS is the Domain Name System. DNS purpose is to convert hostname into IP address.

4. The query string recovers specific information from the database/website.

5. The two HTTP request methods that we learned are the GET method and POST method. Get is a request without side-effects.
Post is a request with side effects and will impact the server by adding some sort of information to it.

6. An HTTP request is when a web browser(client) requests something from a particular server. 

7. An HTTP response is made by a server to a client. 

8. Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. Request headers are cookies and cache control. Response headers include content-type and last modified information.

9. Your browser turns the website name into an IP address using DNS. The browser makes a request to the server. The server then sends back a response. If it is successful, the browser then makes a DOM from the HTML sent from the server.
The browser also makes seperate HTTP requests for those resources such as images,CSS, Javascript, etc.
